    <h1>WebExtreme</h1>
    <h3>A quarantine challenge for web developers</h3>
    <h4>Rules:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Creating a CRUD using only HTML and C++.
    </li>
    <li>
    Only allowed libs? The ones that come with standard Ubuntu.
    </li>
    <li>
    Also, you must parse and create HTTP requests and responses.
    </li>
    <li>
    Your CRUD must be of a resource such as a blog post, with more than 1 field. For example: Blog post has title, body, id and poster (all simple strings).
    </li>
    <li>
    Your resources has to be persistent. When you create a post, it should be there next time even if you shut down the server.
    </li>
    <li>
    Bonus points: port foward your IP on your router and make it accessible by anyone.
    </li>
    </ul>
